Experiments in POS and ATM integration

## Use Case: ATM Initiated Cash Out

This use case involves two parties: ATM and Customer. ATM initiates a Cash-Out request from the customer account and the customer confirms the request by providing authentication (OTP) on ATM. The customer pre-generates an OTP for cash-out and uses this OTP on ATM device to initiate ATM Cash-out. The Payer FSP validates the OTP received in ATM-Initiated Cash-Out request for the validity of OTP as well as for authentication. If the customer authentication via OTP is successful; then the customer’s account will be debited at Payer FSP and ATM account maintained at Payee FSP will be credited. As a result, the customer receives cash from ATM.

### Transaction flow
Firstly, customer will have to generate OTP through mobile application for desired ATM Initiated Cash-out amount. This OTP will be sent to customer’s mobile number. 
We intend to use the FSP simulator to simulate the Payer and Payee FSP's. An endpoint to generate and validate OTP will be implemented on the Simulator. The ATM/POS driver would be responsible for the conversion of ISO to Open API

  - Customer generates an OTP before initiating the transaction request from ATM.
  - The customer initiates withdrawal transaction on the ATM by entering their account ID and amount. 
  - Cash Out Request will be generated by ATM Driver in NDC protocol. This will be converted to OPEN API call and will be sent to Mojaloop.
  - Mojaloop will perform Account lookup and the transaction request will be sent to Payer FSP for authentication.
  - The Payer FSP validates the transaction request and also calculate the Quote for the transaction.
  - The calculated Quote will be displayed on the Terminal for confirmation by the Payee.
  - The Customer will authenticate the transaction by entering pre-generated OTP.
  - Payer FSP will authenticate the OTP. 
  - If successful, the customer’s account will be debited, and the ATM account maintained by Payee FSP will be credited.
  - Payer FSP will send response back to Mojaloop.
  - Response will be received by ATM Driver in OPEN API. This will be converted to ISO and is sent to ATM.
  - ATM will perform the actions as mentioned by the message. (Dispense and Print etc.)

## Use Case: Merchant Initiated Merchant Payment Authorised on POS

This use case describes a merchant payment initiated by a merchant using a device such as POS, and how to authorize a transaction with an OTP or a QR code.
The merchant initiates a merchant payment transaction using a POS device. This device has the capability to capture the customer’s authorization on POS instead of the customer’s mobile device. The authorization information captured in POS should be sent to Payer FSP to perform the authorization.
The business process involves two parties, Merchant and Customer. The merchant initiates a request to pay for the customer, and the customer reviews the payment request on POS and authorizes the payment by OTP or QR code on the POS itself. The customer authentication information is sent from Payee FSP to Payer FSP for authentication by Payer FSP. If authentication is successful then transaction will be posted on Payer FSP and Payee FSP

### Transaction flow

  - Customer requests for an OTP ( pre-generate OTP using mobile app/CMS)
  - Merchant will initiate payment for the desired amount and Customer ID through POS device.
  - The request will be converted from ISO to OPEN API and will be sent to Mojaloop. From there account lookup will be done and the request will be send to Payer FSP for authorization.
  - The Payer FSP validates the transaction request and also calculate the Quote for the transaction.
  - The calculated Quote will be displayed on the Terminal for confirmation by the Payee. 
  - The Payer FSP will authorize the transaction with dynamic OTP (or QR Code) which is generated through mobile application and entered by the customer.
  - If Payer FSP authorizes the transaction, funds will be sent to Merchant (Payee) FSP. If Payer FSP declines, the transaction will be aborted. 
  - Response will be sent back to POS driver through Mojaloop in OPEN API. It will be converted to ISO(POS) and will send the response to POS.
  - Notification will be sent to Payer and Payee from respective FSP’s.
  
  ## Simulator Endpoints
As a part of the terminal integration project, we will be making use of the FSP simulator, to function as the Payer and Payee FSP as per the use cases. 
In order to cater this functionality, three new endpoints will be implemented on the simulator as below:
•	OTP Endpoint
•	ATM Endpoint
•	POS Endpoint

### OTP Endpoint
The OTP Endpoint will be responsible for the handling of OTP requests from the Payer source. Upon receipt of an OTP request, the endpoint will generate the OTP and respond through the same channel.

### ATM Endpoint
ATM Endpoint will be responsible for the handling and processing of transactions originating from ATM devices. The transactions in ISO/NDC/DDC formats will be converted to Open API and processed through the simulator.

### POS Endpoint
The POS Endpoint is implemented to handle and process transactions originating from POS and mPOS devices. Similar to the ATM Endpoint, the transactions from POS devices in the ISO format will be processed by the endpoint through the simulator.
